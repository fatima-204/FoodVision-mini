Food Vision Mini üçïü•©üç£
Food Vision Mini is a food classification model that categorizes images into three classes: Pizza, Steak, and Sushi. It uses an EfficientNet-B2 model as a feature extractor to achieve quick and accurate classification. This project showcases the power of deep learning and computer vision.

Features
Image Classification: Classifies images of food into three categories: Pizza, Steak, and Sushi.

EfficientNet-B2: Utilizes a pre-trained EfficientNet-B2 model for feature extraction and fine-tuned to classify the three types of food.

Real-time Predictions: Users can upload an image of food and get instant predictions with a display of classification probabilities and prediction time.

Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch (for model building and inference)

Gradio (for creating the user interface)

PIL (Python Imaging Library for image manipulation)

EfficientNet-B2 (pre-trained deep learning model for feature extraction)

Dataset
This project uses a small set of food images for demonstration purposes (Pizza, Steak, and Sushi). You can add more images to the examples/ folder to test the classifier further.

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

PyTorch

Gradio

PIL

torchvision

Model Architecture
The model is based on EfficientNet-B2, a lightweight and highly efficient deep learning model. The classifier head is modified to output probabilities for three classes: Pizza, Steak, and Sushi.

Key Layers:
EfficientNet-B2 feature extractor.

Dropout layer for regularization.

Fully connected layer that maps the features to the class probabilities.
